# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Things needed to add 
- need to add debouncing and filter using lowercase in filter ✅
- optimize the code -> implemented Lazy loading ✅
- add loader to Send Money and success alert or something ✅
- close the routes so only logged in user can access the routes
- make signin page functionable ✅
- remove yourself from the list of users in UsesList ✅
- use some auth to get user data 
- hash the password before sending to the database ✅
- made balance from backend to frontend
